# Robot simulator

## Approaches and design patterns:


The current project utilizes the Command Pattern, a design pattern that seamlessly aligns with the concept of the Robot Proof of Concept (POC). 
This design pattern proves to be an excellent fit, as it effectively decouples dependencies between various layers by encapsulating requests.

## Possible improvements:
1. Can try to use fabric or strategy patterns if we need to work with different types of robots/machines.

## How to run
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run test`
